Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
##  Middleware in Node.js is a collection of functions and
## methods that are used to process and manipulate data during 
## the request-response cycle.  Middleware has access to the 
## "req" and "res" objects involved in an API call and can be chained to
## create more robust functionality when dealing with challenges
## like authentication and error handling

What does CRUD stand for?

## C - Create R - Read U - Update D - Delete

You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file:

    How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?

## You can use the dotenv library.  Just require 'dotenv'.config() 
## then access the .env variables with 'process.env.<variable_name>'

    How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?

## By default .env files are usually included in your .gitignore file, 
## but you can and should double check to make sure that it is so your
## .env file doesn't get pushed to Github
